I WANT TO SUBMIT RESET PASSWORD FORM EMPTY FIELD

I am on page '/forgot' 
I am going to 'submit reset password form with empty email field' 
I click 'Reset' 
I expect 'to see the error message "Email Required' 
I see 'Email Required' 
I expect 'to see the error message "Email Required under the form field' 
I see element(locator::contains 'span'," 'Email Required')"
