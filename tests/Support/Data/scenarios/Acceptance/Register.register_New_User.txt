I WANT TO REGISTER NEW USER

I am on page '/register' 
I am going to 'submit register form with correct data' 
I expect 'data to be entered into database' 
I expect 'to see a red error message "Registration Failed" & "Invalid Username or Email" if the username or password is already in the db' 
I expect 'to see the message "Email confirmation instructions have been sent. Check your spam folder.' 
I see 'Email confirmation instructions have been sent. Check your spam folder.' 
I expect 'email sent to registered email with link to activate account'
