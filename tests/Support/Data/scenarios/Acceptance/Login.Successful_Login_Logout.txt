I WANT TO SUCCESSFUL LOGIN LOGOUT

I am on page '/login' 
I am going to 'submit login form with a correct username & password field' 
I expect 'to see the text "Dashboard' 
I see 'The Dashboard' 
I expect 'to see "Logout " and click it to logout' 
I click 'Log Out' 
I expect 'to see "You have been successfully logged out.' 
I see 'You have been successfully logged out.'
