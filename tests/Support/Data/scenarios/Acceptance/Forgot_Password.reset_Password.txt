I WANT TO RESET PASSWORD

I am on page '/forgot' 
I am going to 'submit a properly formatted email address' 
I submit form '#forgot'," ['email' => 'calvin99@example.com',"]" 
I expect 'to see a message that says "If your email is in our system you will receive reset instructions.' 
I see 'If your email is in our system you will receive reset instructions.' 
I expect 'to get an email with a password reset link if the submitted email is in the DB'
