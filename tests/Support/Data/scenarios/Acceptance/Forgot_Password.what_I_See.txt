I WANT TO WHAT I SEE

I am on page '/' 
I click 'Forgot Password' 
I see in title 'Perfect App Starter' 
I expect 'to see a Url /forgot' 
I see current url equals '/forgot' 
I expect 'to see a H3 title that says "Password Reset' 
I see 'Password Reset'," 'H3' 
I expect 'to see a label that says "Email' 
I see element(locator::contains 'label'," 'Email')" 
I see element 'label'," ['for' => 'inputResetPasswordEmail']" 
I expect 'to see a a form input' 
I see element 'input'," ['name' => 'email']" 
I expect 'to see the text under the input that says "Password reset instructions will be sent to this email address' 
I see element(locator::contains 'span'," 'Password reset instructions will be sent to this email address')" 
I expect 'to see a "Reset" button' 
I see 'Reset'," '.btn-primary'
