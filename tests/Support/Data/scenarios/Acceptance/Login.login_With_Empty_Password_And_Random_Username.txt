I WANT TO LOGIN WITH EMPTY PASSWORD AND RANDOM USERNAME

I am on page '/login' 
I am going to 'submit login form with empty password & a random username' 
I expect 'to see a red error message "Password Required' 
I see 'Password Required'," '.danger' 
I expect 'to see a red error message under the Password field "Password Required' 
I see 'Password Required'," '.invalid-feedback'
